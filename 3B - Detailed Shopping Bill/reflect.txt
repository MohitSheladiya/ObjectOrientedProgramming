This week’s workshop was about learning how to use a class. Using a class made the program much simpler rather than using a struct as per my view. The lab part was big but easy to understand because of the use of the class. Modules which were to be created by me were item.cpp and Bill.cpp; At first I created the item.cpp because it contained all the basic function which were to be used in bill.cpp such as setName(), setEmpty(), set(), price() and so on. Purpose of all these functions were to set string, check condition, return a calculated value or display a line which contained information about item name, price and taxable (True or False). For Bill.cpp, we can say that it contained the final algorithm which had all the final calculations as well as final display function. This module has a little challenge with it for displaying all the information taken  from the main function, which I overcome by the help of professor’s notes. At the end, while I had to debug; I got an unknown error while submitting my work on matrix. The error stated that I used “strlen” in a wrong way, but the problem was that I didn’t used any cstring functions at all. But after reading the code, I finally got the error which was in item.cpp in the setName()  function where I didn’t initialize the last char to ‘\0’ which was a big trouble I don’t know why.
At last, I will talk about the DIY which was almost the same as the Lab part; the difference was that I had to count total number of calories consumed in a day instead of price. I had to make some minor changes in-order to get the desired output. Changes like accepting first 30 chars from the string ‘itemname’, change all the return values to integer from double (because calories were in integer format), changing the display function a bit. Finally, I had to remove the ‘m_taxed’ (bool type) part from Lab and instead of that I had to use ‘m_meal’ which was an int type. In that there were 4 categories 1) breakfast, 2) lunch, 3) dinner and 4) snacks. After making all these changes I completed the program.
